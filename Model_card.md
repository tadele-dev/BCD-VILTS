# BCD-VILTS: Breast Cancer Detection via Vision-and-Language Transformer with Self-Attention Fusion

## üß† Model Overview
BCD-VILTS is a custom multimodal AI model for breast cancer detection that fuses visual (image) and textual (clinical notes) data using a Transformer-based fusion block. It is designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy by modeling complex interactions between radiological imagery and corresponding clinical reports.

## üí° Key Features

- **Multimodal Fusion**: Combines image and text using deep self-attention fusion.
- **Transformer-Based Architecture**: Utilizes ResNet-50 as an image encoder, BERT as a text encoder, and a multi-layer Transformer for fusion.
- **Image as [CLS] Token**: Treats visual embeddings as the primary anchor for classification.
- **Modality Drop Tolerance**: Robust under missing or incomplete modality inputs.
- **Explainability**: Provides cross-modal attention maps for interpretability.
- **Edge-Ready**: ONNX-compatible for mobile and edge deployment.
